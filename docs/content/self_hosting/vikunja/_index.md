I use [vikunja](https://vikunja.io/) as my personal self-hosted to-do app with PostgreSQL backend, persistent storage via Longhorn, and managed via ArgoCD deployment (see [manifests](https://github.com/cunialino/homelab/tree/main/base/vikunja))

This is my first experiment of self-hosting, I choose this app as its not critical
and even if my homelab shuts down unexpectedly it doesn't bother me much.

I run it as a simple deployment that you can find [here](https://github.com/cunialino/homelab/tree/main/base/vikunja).
