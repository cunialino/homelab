In this section I document self-hosted apps running in my homelab.

## Why self hosting?

I've been drawn to self-hosting for one primary reason: the challenge of reliability.
Running services that I rely on daily means I have to ensure they stay up 24/7.

Granted, this is a homelab—if I overload the circuit by running too many appliances at once,
the breaker trips and everything goes down. 
Despite those "real-world" constraints, I find it a rewarding technical challenge to maximize uptime and maintain a stable environment for as long as possible.
