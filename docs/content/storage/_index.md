Reliable and performant storage is a critical component of my homelab. Here, I leverage a combination of Longhorn for distributed block storage and RustFS for network file sharing.

Longhorn provides a highly available and resilient storage solution for my Kubernetes workloads, ensuring data persistence and protection against node failures. RustFS offers a flexible and efficient way to share files across the network, catering to various data access needs.
